End-to-End AI Project Idea: "AI Tutor for Indian Students"

I want to develop a complete end-to-end AI project called AI Tutor, specifically designed to assist school students in India with their studies. The core goal of this project is to build an intelligent learning platform powered by LLMs (Large Language Models) that are fine-tuned or aligned with NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) curriculum content, covering all subjects and standards from Class 6 to Class 12.

âœ… Objectives:
To build a personalized AI tutor for students using NCERT textbooks as the knowledge base.

Provide interactive learning, doubt-solving, concept explanations, and quiz-based practice.

Make learning more accessible, engaging, and accurate for students from all backgrounds.

ðŸ§  Technical Stack & Key Components:
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) â€“ for pulling contextually relevant information from NCERT material.

LangChain â€“ to orchestrate the LLM workflow with memory, tools, and retrieval chains.

Hugging Face Transformers / LLMs â€“ for question answering, explanations, and conversation.

Vector Store (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate) â€“ for storing and retrieving NCERT book embeddings.

Text Embedding Models (e.g., Hugging Face models, GEMINI, GROQ, or BGE) â€“ to convert NCERT data into semantic vectors.

Streamlitâ€“ to build an interactive and user-friendly frontend.

Backend (e.g., FastAPI / Flask) â€“ for serving APIs to handle student interactions.

ðŸ“š Dataset:
Full corpus of NCERT books (PDFs or text) from Class 6â€“12 across subjects like Science, Maths, Social Science, English, Hindi, etc.

These will be parsed, chunked, embedded, and indexed for retrieval.

ðŸ’¡ Features to Implement:
Ask Doubts â€“ Students can ask any question from their syllabus and get an AI-generated answer with supporting explanations.

Explain a Topic â€“ Users can enter a chapter/topic name and get a summarized or detailed explanation.

Quiz Generator â€“ Auto-generate quizzes based on selected chapters for self-assessment.

Homework Helper â€“ Students can get help with understanding problems step-by-step.

 Support for English
